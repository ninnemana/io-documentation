/**
 * Pub operates over a directed graph of dependencies that starts at a root
 * "entrypoint" package. This is typically the package where the current
 * working directory is located. An entrypoint knows the [root] package it is
 * associated with and is responsible for managing the "packages" directory
 * for it.
 *
 * That directory contains symlinks to all packages used by an app. These links
 * point either to the [SystemCache] or to some other location on the local
 * filesystem.
 *
 * While entrypoints are typically applications, a pure library package may end
 * up being used as an entrypoint. Also, a single package may be used as an
 * entrypoint in one context but not in another. For example, a package that
 * contains a reusable library may not be the entrypoint when used by an app,
 * but may be the entrypoint when you're running its tests.
