What does "Be Prepared" mean for v8?

	Hidden Classes
		Hidden classes make js faster
			v8 internally creates hidden classes for objects at runtime
			Objects with the same hidden class can use the same optimimized code
			
			Example
				function Point(x, y){
					this.x = x;
					this.y = y;
				}
				var p1 = new Point(11, 22);
				var p2 = new Point(33, 44);
				p2.z = 55;


	Avoid Speed Traps
		Initialize all objects members in contructor functions
		Always intialize object members in the same order

		How does v8 represent values?
			Tagged Values

		Prefer numeric values that can represented as 31-bit signed integers

	Arrays
	
		Handling Large and Sparse Arrays
			Fast elements: linear sotrage for compact key sets
			Dictionary elements: hash table storage arrays

		Use contiguous keys starting at 0 for Arrays

		Don't pre-allocate large Arrays

		Dont delete elements in arrays, espeically numeric arrays

		Dont load unintialized Arrays
			a = new Array();
			for(var b = 0; b < 10; b++){
				a[0] |= b;
			}

		Double Array Unboxing
			Array's hidden class tracks elements types
			Arrays containing only doubles are unboxed
			Unboxing causes hidden class change

			var a = new Array();
			a[0] = 77l // Allocates
			a[1] = 88;
			a[2] = 0.5; // Allocates, converts
			a[3] = true; // Allocates, converts

			Hidden Classes for Elements - A better way
			var a = [77, 88, 0.5, true];

		Preallocate small arrays to correct size before using them

		Don't store non-numeric values in numeric arrays

	Compilers

		Full
			Quickly generates good but not great JIT code
			Assumes (almost) nothing about types at compile time
			
			Inline Cache
				Validate type assumptions first, then do work
				Type dependent code for operations
				Change at runtime via backpatching as more types are discovered
				Prefer monomorphic code polymorphic

		Optimized
			Type feebad makes code faters
				Types taken from ICs
				Operations specualatively get inlined
				Monomorphic functions and constructors can be inlined entirely
				Inline enables other optimizations

			Logging what gets optimized
				d8 -time-output time.js

			Optimizing compiler bails out on functions with try/catch blocks
				- Workaround
						function performTest(x){

						}
						try{
							performText(null)
						}catch(e){
							// Handle exception
						}

	Avoid hidden class changes in functions after they are optimized
